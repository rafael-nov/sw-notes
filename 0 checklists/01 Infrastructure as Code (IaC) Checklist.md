## Advanced IaC Practices

### IaC Testing and Validation
- [ ] Static code analysis for IaC (e.g., using tools like TFLint for Terraform)
- [ ] Unit testing for IaC configurations (e.g., Terratest for Terraform)
- [ ] End-to-end integration testing of infrastructure deployments
- [ ] Running automated tests in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Mocking cloud resources for test environments

### Security and Compliance
- [ ] Using policies as code (e.g., Sentinel for Terraform, Open Policy Agent)
- [ ] Scanning IaC templates for security vulnerabilities (e.g., Checkov, tfsec)
- [ ] Managing access control and permissions for IaC tools (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS IAM)
- [ ] Encrypting sensitive data in IaC (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Ensuring compliance with organizational policies and standards

### Environment Management
- [ ] Managing multiple environments (dev, staging, production) with IaC
- [ ] Using workspaces or stacks for environment isolation
- [ ] Strategies for promoting changes across environments (e.g., promoting Terraform workspaces)
- [ ] Implementing blue-green or canary deployments with IaC

### State Management and Backups
- [ ] Configuring remote state storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking for Terraform)
- [ ] Ensuring state file consistency and integrity
- [ ] Implementing state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- [ ] Backing up and restoring state files
- [ ] Managing state files for multiple environments and teams
